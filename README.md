This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Install then run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Note
So I had only a few hours for this so I made it a little bit rough with incomplete dark mode (althought it works)
There are two pages: dashboard and settings follow your description test
